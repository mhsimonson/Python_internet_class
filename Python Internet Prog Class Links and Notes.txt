Here is the assignment:

Your machine details:
username: mhsimo23
password: markhsimonson@hc
hostname: block115399-f9p.blueboxgrid.com

On linux and Mac computers, you should be able to open a terminal and
log into your machine by typing:
ssh mhsimo23@block115399-f9p.blueboxgrid.com

On Windows, I recommend installing PuTTY:
